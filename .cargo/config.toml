# Keep Cargo artifacts out of the repo working tree by default.
# This relative path is resolved from the command working directory (repo root in typical usage),
# which places artifacts under a sibling directory outside the repo (e.g. `~/ .cmnd-n-ctrl-target` here).
target-dir = "../../.cmnd-n-ctrl-target"
